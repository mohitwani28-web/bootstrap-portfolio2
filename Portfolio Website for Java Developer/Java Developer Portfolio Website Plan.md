# Java Developer Portfolio Website Plan

## Key Sections:

Based on the research, a typical Java developer portfolio website should include the following key sections:

1.  **About Me/Introduction:** A brief professional bio highlighting career goals, technical strengths, and what excites the developer about software development.
2.  **Skills:** A comprehensive list of technical skills, including programming languages (Java, Python, etc.), frameworks (Spring, Hibernate), tools (Git, Maven), databases, and other relevant technologies.
3.  **Projects:** This is the most crucial section. It should showcase 3-5 impactful projects. For each project, include:
    *   Clear descriptions of the project's purpose, technologies used, and the developer's role.
    *   Links to live demos (if applicable) and source code repositories (e.g., GitHub).
    *   Visuals (screenshots, diagrams) to illustrate the project.
    *   Explanation of challenges faced and solutions implemented.
4.  **Experience/Work History (Optional but Recommended):** A summary of relevant work experience, internships, or academic projects.
5.  **Education (Optional):** Details about academic background and relevant certifications.
6.  **Contact:** Information on how to get in touch with the developer (email, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).

## Content Brainstorming:

*   **About Me:** Focus on passion for Java development, problem-solving skills, and eagerness to learn.
*   **Skills:** Categorize skills (e.g., Languages, Frameworks, Databases, Tools, Cloud Platforms).
*   **Projects:** Select diverse projects that demonstrate different aspects of Java development (e.g., a web application, a REST API, a data processing tool, a microservice). Ensure code quality and good documentation for linked repositories.
*   **Contact:** Provide professional contact methods.
